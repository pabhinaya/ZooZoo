ZooZoo

I am a zoo keeper.
So as a zoo keeper I want to:

1. Store all details of animals in my zoo (birds,animals,etc)

When a customer visits my zoo, outside each cage I have a button which on press one can hear the sound of that particular animal.
Info: I have a API ready to convert the given text into sound.

2. When the button is pressed near a dog's cage I should hear:
    "The dog says Bow Bow"
    The same should happen with all other animals present in my zoo.

In future I can add/Remove more animals in my zoo.....
So I will just add the animal in the zoo as you do it in first step, The second one should be taken care automatically :).
